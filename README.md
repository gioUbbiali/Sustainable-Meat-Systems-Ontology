# Sustainable Meat Systems Ontology

## Description

This repository maintains the Sustainable Meat Systems Ontology (SuMSO). SuMSO is a domain ontology addressing meat systems sustainability. SuMSO extends [Sustainability Core Ontology (SCO)](https://github.com/gioUbbiali/Sustainability-Core-Ontology) and [Basic Formal Ontology (BFO)](https://github.com/BFO-ontology/BFO-2020).

See also the [SuMSO documentation webpage](https://w3id.org/sumso/docs).

## Material

Currently, this repository hosts the SuMSO Ontological Module (SuMSO OM). SuMSO OM is a (non-exhaustive) starting basis from which to further implement a stable resource addressing meat systems sustainability in its whole. It provides a representation of the core architectural features of a sustainable meat system. 
Cow-deriving meat systems are the SuMSO OM use-case. SuMSO OM deals with meat in a broad sense: it contemplates the liaisons with other cow-derived materials, such as leather. Future implementations will expand SuMSO representation to cover other meat systems and the interrelations among them. For further details, please refer to [Ubbiali (2025).](https://air.unimi.it/handle/2434/1161515)

SuMSO V1.0.1 is the current release of SuMSO OM. It implements SuMSO V1.0.0 by supplying permanent IRIs. SuMSO V1.0.1 is formalized in [Web Ontology Language (OWL)](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-overview/) and covers English as natural language. SuMSO V1.0.1 encompasses 470 classes, 284 object properties, and 7 individuals. SuMSO V1.0.1. conforms to [OBO-Foundry principles](https://obofoundry.org/principles/fp-000-summary.html).
