# Sustainable Meat Systems Ontology

## Description

This repository maintains the Sustainable Meat Systems Ontology (SuMSO). SuMSO is a domain ontology addressing meat systems sustainability. SuMSO extends [Sustainability Core Ontology (SCO)](https://github.com/gioUbbiali/Sustainability-Core-Ontology) and [Basic Formal Ontology (BFO)](https://github.com/BFO-ontology/BFO-2020).

## Material

Currently, this repository hosts the SuMSO Ontological Module (SuMSO OM). SuMSO OM is a (non-exhaustive) starting basis from which to further implement a stable resource addressing meat systems sustainability in its whole. It provides a representation of the core architectural features of a sustainable meat system. 
SuMSO OM deals with meat in a broad sense – it also contemplates ts liaisons with other cow-derived products, such as leather and milk. The cow meat is the SuMSO OM use-case. For further details, please refer to the publication provided in the “Publications and Documentation” section.

SuMSO V1.0.0 is the first version and the current release of SuMSO OM. It is formalized in [Web Ontology Language (OWL)](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-overview/) and covers English as natural language. SuMSO V1.0.0  conforms to [OBO-Foundry principles](https://obofoundry.org/principles/fp-000-summary.html).

SuMSO V1.0.0 is implemented  in [OWL/XML](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-overview/), [RDF/XML](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/), and [Terse RDF Triple Language](https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/). 

The publication provided in the “Publications and Documentation” section presents the process of development of SuMSO V1.0.0. Materials have been organized considering a possible future migration of this repo to the [Ontology Development Kit (ODK)](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit).
