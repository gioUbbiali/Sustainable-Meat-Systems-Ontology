# Material for implementation

This folder contains the materials for implementing SuMSO, including:

- A non-exhaustive list of competency questions CQs (SuMSO CQs), in Word and PDF formats (as of 2025-02-10).
- A non-exhaustive list of topics for implementation (Topics for SuMSO implementations), in Word and PDF formats (as of 2025-02-10).
- A list of ontologies from which SuMSO currently reuses or adapts classes and object properties (SuMSO imports), in Word and PDF formats (as of 2024-12-05).
- A list of the terms that SuMSO currently covers or that we aim to include with further implementations, in Excel and PDF formats (as of 2024-12-12).
- [Reference](https://github.com/gioUbbiali/Sustainable-Meat-Systems-Ontology/blob/main/SuMSO/src/ontology/imports/foodon-imports-tot.rdf) to a RDF file containing FoodOn imports, in addition to those already included in SuMSO, that we envisioned reuse into this ontology. SuMSO currently covers only [those](https://github.com/gioUbbiali/Sustainable-Meat-Systems-Ontology/blob/main/SuMSO/src/ontology/imports/foodon-initial-imports.owl) judged the most relevant ones for the purposes of creating an initial core ontological module.
