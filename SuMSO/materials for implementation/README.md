# Material for implementation

This folder contains the materials for implementing SuMSO, including:

- A non-exhaustive list of competency questions CQs (SuMSO CQs), in Word and PDF formats.
- A non-exhaustive list of topics for implementation, in Word and PDF formats.
- A list of the terms that SuMSO currently covers (blue ones) and that we aim to include with further implementations, in Excel and PDF formats.
- [Reference](https://github.com/gioUbbiali/Sustainable-Meat-Systems-Ontology/blob/main/SuMSO/src/ontology/imports/foodon-imports-tot.rdf) to the RDF file containing FoodOn classes, in addition to those already included in SuMSO, that we envisioned importing into this ontology. SuMSO includes those judged the most relevant ones for the purposes of creating a core ontological module.
