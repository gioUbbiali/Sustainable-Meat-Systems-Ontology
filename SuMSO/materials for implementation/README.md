# Material for implementation

This folder contains the materials for implementing SuMSO, including:

- A non-exhaustive list of competency questions CQs (SuMSO CQs), in Word and PDF formats.
- A non-exhaustive list of topics for implementation (Topics for SuMSO implementations), in Word and PDF formats.
- A list of ontologies from which SuMSO currently reuses or adapts classes and object properties (SuMSO imports), in Word and PDF formats.
- A list of the terms that SuMSO currently covers (blue ones) or that we aim to include with further implementations, in Excel and PDF formats.
- [Reference](https://github.com/gioUbbiali/Sustainable-Meat-Systems-Ontology/blob/main/SuMSO/src/ontology/imports/foodon-imports-tot.rdf) to a RDF file containing FoodOn classes, in addition to those already included in SuMSO, that we envisioned importing into this ontology. SuMSO currently covers only those judged the most relevant ones for the purposes of creating a core ontological module.
