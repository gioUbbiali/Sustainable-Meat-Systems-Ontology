# Material for implementation

This folder contains the materials for implementing SuMSO, including:

- A non-exhaustive list of competency questions CQs (SuMSO CQs), in Word and PDF formats.
- A non-exhaustive list of topics for implementation (Topics for SuMSO implementations), in Word and PDF formats.
- A list of ontologies from which SuMSO currently reuses or adapts classes and object properties (SuMSO imports), in Word and PDF formats.
- A list of the terms that SuMSO currently covers or that we aim to include with further implementations, in Excel and PDF formats.

  *List Legenda*
  
  - Terms highlighted in blue: terms currently covered and formalized in SuMSO.
  - Terms not highlighted: terms that SuMSO will cover and formalize.
  - Terms presenting an “*”: terms that have been (also) proposed by stakeholders. 
  - Terms indicated with a “†”: terms on which stakeholders’ suggestions primarily focused. 

- [Reference](https://github.com/gioUbbiali/Sustainable-Meat-Systems-Ontology/blob/main/SuMSO/src/ontology/imports/foodon-imports-tot.rdf) to a RDF file containing FoodOn imports, in addition to those already included in SuMSO, that we envisioned reuse into this ontology. SuMSO currently covers only [those](https://github.com/gioUbbiali/Sustainable-Meat-Systems-Ontology/blob/main/SuMSO/src/ontology/imports/foodon-initial-imports.owl) judged the most relevant ones for the purposes of creating an initial core ontological module.
